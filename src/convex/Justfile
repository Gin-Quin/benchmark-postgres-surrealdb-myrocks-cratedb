# `just --list` (or just `just`) will print all the recipes in
# the current Justfile. `just RECIPE` will run the macro/job.
#
# In several places there are recipes for running common scripts or commands.
# Instead of `Makefile`s, Convex uses Justfiles, which are similar, but avoid
# several footguns associated with Makefiles, since using make as a macro runner
# can sometimes conflict with Makefiles desire to have some rudimentary
# understanding of build artifacts and associated dependencies.
