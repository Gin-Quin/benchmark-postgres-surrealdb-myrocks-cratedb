This only works on MacOS. If you are on Linux, download the convex binaries and replace `.database/convex-local-backend` with the Linux binary.

1. Go to `./database` and run `./convex-local-backend` in the terminal.
2. Open a new terminal panel and run `just convex dev` in the main convex directory.
3. Open a third terminal panel and run `bun run index.ts`
